# Q Docs

> Documentation for using the Q API

Q Docs are built using [Slate](http://tripit.github.io/slate). This is a clone of their excellent project.

Getting Started with Slate
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

 1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/Aplo/q-docs.git`
 2. `cd q-docs`
 3. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 4. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. Whoa! That was fast!

*Note: if you're using the Docker setup on OSX, the docs will be
availalable at the output of `boot2docker ip` instead of `localhost:4567`.*
